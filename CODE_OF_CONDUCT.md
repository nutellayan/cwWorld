- Using non-offensive and welcoming language at all times
- Respecting the opinions and positions of others
- Providing constructive and helpful criticism
- Focusing on helping both individuals and the community as a whole
- Showing kindness to others

Unacceptable behavior that goes against our pledge includes:

- Using sexual language, imagery, or intention
- Purposely insulting, harassing, or degrading others publicly or privately
- Releasing others' personal information (physical or electronic) without their permission
- Engaging in any inappropriate behavior in a professional environment

### Our Responsibilities:

As project maintainers, we are responsible for upholding these standards of behavior and taking appropriate corrective actions when unacceptable behavior occurs. We reserve the right to remove and edit comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. We also reserve the right to ban individual contributors for behavior deemed inappropriate.

### Scope:

Our Code of Conduct applies regardless of whether interactions occur in public or project spaces, as long as an individual is representing the community/project. This includes posting on official project social media accounts, using official project email addresses, or participating in online and offline project events. The definition of representation may be further clarified by project maintainers if necessary.
