**CODE OF CONDUCT**

**Our Pledge:**

We pledge as contributors and maintainers to foster an inclusive, open and safe environment for our community. Allowing all individuals, regardless of their ethnicity, sex, age, disability, gender-identity, education, social-economic status, religion, nationality and appearance to operate within it without facing any judgement, discrimination or harassment.

**Our Standards:**

Acceptable behaviour which will allow us to honour our pledge:

•	None-offence and welcoming language use always

•	Respecting other individuals’ opinions and positions

•	Constructive and helpful criticism

•	A focus on not only helping individuals, but also the community in general

•	Always showing kindness to other individuals

Unacceptable Behaviour which will go against our pledge:

•	Any use of sexual language, imagery or intention will not be permitted

•	Purposely insulting, harassing and degrading other individuals publicly or privately

•	Releasing others personal information (physical or electronic) without that individuals’ permission

•	Any general inappropriate behaviour in a professional environment

**Our Responsibilities:**

We, as project maintainers, have the responsibility of upholding these standards of behaviour and are expected to carry out appropriate corrective actions in the instances where unacceptable behaviour has occurred. We have the right to remove and edit comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. As well as the right to ban individual contributers for behaviour which is deemed inappropriate.

**Scope:**

Regardless of whether it is within public or project spaces our Code of Conduct will still apply when an individual is representing the community/project. Examples of this could be posting on an official project social media account, an official project email address or any online and offline project events. The definition of representation can be further clarified by the project maintainers if it is felt necessary.

**Enforcement:**

Any instances of this code of conduct being broken should be reported to the project team (40766197@live.napier.ac.uk) where all complaints will be investigated and assessed. We will respond as soon as possible, and this will result in a punishment which is felt necessary depending on the specific circumstances. The reporter will remain anonymous and the incident will be confidential. These rules also apply to project maintainers who do not follow the code of conduct as well, any breech of conduct may result in repercussion that are determined by other members of the projects leadership.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html
